# Damage Grid
To simplify rules text and illustrate the extent of effects over a wide area, some cards show a damage grid, e.g. [[Craterize]].

Damage grids may use a bold square to indicate the center of the card’s effect, or a dot to show the Spellcaster’s location on the grid, e.g. [[Cone of Flame]].

A damage grid may be rotated and reflected, though some effects may specify otherwise. E.g. [[Flame Wave]] may only be reflected, not rotated.

A damage grid affects each unit at the shown squares and **in the same region as the caster**, though some effects may specify otherwise. E.g. [[Craterize]] specifies "above and below." 

An effect with a damage grid may be oriented so that the grid is partially outside the realm, as long as the source or origin square in the realm.
