# Movement +X
**Keyword Ability. **A unit with Movement +X may move up to X additional steps when using the Move and Attack or Defend basic abilities. For example, [[Rimland Nomads]] may take two steps instead of just one.

If a unit has multiple copies of the Movement +X ability, the numbers simply add together. For example, [[Rimland Nomads]] with [[Mad Dash]] have Movement +2.
