# Carrying Artifacts
Many artifacts can be carried by units, and carried artifacts are moved along with the unit that's carrying them. For example, [[Ruby Core]] can be carried by a unit. See "((Carriable Artifacts))" for more details on which artifacts can be carried, and how control may change for such artifacts.

See the "Pick Up" and "Drop" basic abilities, as well as "((Casting Artifacts))," for details on how a unit might start or stop carrying an artifact. See "((Stealth))" for how it benefits carried artifacts.

If an Oversized Unit is carrying an artifact, the artifact remains in a single location and maintains relative positioning to the Oversized Unit. See "((Oversized Units))" and "((Teleporting Oversized Units))" for further details.

An artifact that's being carried must share at least one location with the unit that's carrying it. If they ever share no locations, the carried artifact is automatically dropped.

Non-units cannot carry artifacts. If a non-unit is somehow carrying an artifact, the artifact is immediately dropped.

If a unit is forcefully moved, anything they're carrying moves with them, e.g. [[Bury]]. If a minion leaves the realm, anything they're carrying remains in the realm, e.g. [[Fey Changeling]], [[Cast into Exile]], [[Monster Hunter]].
