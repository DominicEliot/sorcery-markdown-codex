# Atlas
Your atlas is your deck of sites and is one of the zones in the game.

Only sites can be placed or shuffled into your atlas. If an effect would cause a spell card to be shuffled into an atlas, that effect is ignored.

**Constructed Format**  
Your atlas must contain 30 or more sites and respect rarity limits.

**Limited Formats (Draft or Sealed)**  
Your atlas must contain 12 or more sites, ignoring rarity restrictions.
