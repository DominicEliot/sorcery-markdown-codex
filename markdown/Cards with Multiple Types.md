# Cards with Multiple Types
It's possible for cards to have multiple types. For example, automatons are minions and artifacts.

It's also possible for cards to gain types during the game. For example, [[Enchantress]] can cause auras to gain the minion type for a turn.

When a card has multiple types, apply the following rules regarding characteristics:

- The **default size remains unchanged**.
   - If the card was already occupying multiple locations (e.g. an aura) and becomes a minion (e.g. via [[Enchantress]]), it continues to occupy multiple locations even though minions default to a single location.
- For everything other than size, the **characteristics of a minion take precedence**. For example:
   - Artifacts can be carried, while minions cannot be carried by default. Therefore, artifact minions cannot be carried as an artifact would be, since we give preference to the minion rules.
      - Note that artifact minions _can_ be carried as a minion would be carried (e.g. [[War Horse]]).
   - Auras cannot carry artifacts. Minions can carry artifacts. Therefore, Aura minions can carry artifacts, since we give preference to the minion rules.
