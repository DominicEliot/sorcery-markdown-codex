# Path
A path for a card that's moving involves 1 or more steps, and each step has a starting and ending location that's different. If your step is from a location to that same location, you didn't actually move anywhere. If you occupied multiple locations while moving, all of those locations are included in your path, including for oversized units.

A path for projectiles is a bit different, and can include just the starting location. See "((projectiles))" for more details.
