# Carriable Artifact
A carriable artifact is any artifact that's not a ((monument)) and not a minion (i.e. not an ((automaton))). Carriable artifacts have additional options when being cast as a spell. See "((Casting Artifacts))" for more details, and "((Ownership and Control))" for details on how control can change for carriable artifacts.
