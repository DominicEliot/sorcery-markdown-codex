# Ranged, Ranged X, and +X Range
**Keyword Ability. **Ranged is a keyword that grants a unit the following activated ability:

_Tap → Shoot a projectile that stops after 1 step. Strike the hit unit._

If a unit has Ranged X, e.g. Ranged 3 on [[Fail-not Bow]], then replace "1 step" with "X steps."

Multiple copies of the Ranged ability do not provide additional range, but if an effect explicitly uses +X Range, e.g. [[Vantage Hills]], then the number of steps the projectile can travel increases accordingly.

The ranged projectile follows normal projectile rules.

If the projectile hits a unit, the ranged shooter strikes the hit unit. This follows normal strike rules, even though the shooter and the struck unit might be in different locations, e.g. a Lance will inflict +1 damage and break.

Note that the ranged ability shoots a projectile that may hit a unit; it will not hit sites, and thus cannot damage sites in that way (use the Move and Attack ability instead).
