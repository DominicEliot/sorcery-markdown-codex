# Special Ability
Anything printed in the text box of a card is considered a special ability, as well as any other abilities it gains via other effects, e.g. [[Charge!]]. Special abilities have four categories, described in their own codex entries:

- Keyword ability
- Passive ability
- Activated ability
- Triggered ability
