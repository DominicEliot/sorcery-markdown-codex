# Defend
Defend is a basic ability that allows you to defend against your opponent's attacks. A unit must be untapped to defend, and it's one of two basic abilities that you can use on your opponent’s turn (the other is Intercept). Defend is a triggered ability with the following text:

_When an enemy attacks another unit or site in this unit's range of motion, it may tap to defend, moving to the attack's location and joining the fight._

When an attack is occurring, there is a window to defend. See the "((attack))" codex entry for further details. During that window, multiple different units can defend, one at a time.

When a unit moves to defend, it may use any of its movement abilities, such as Airborne, Burrowing, Movement +X, Submerge, or Voidwalk.

If the original target of the attack was a unit, the defender’s controller may decide if that unit remains in the fight, or is removed. If the original target was a site, it is automatically removed.

Remember, only “attacks” can be defended; attacks are only caused by the Move and Attack basic ability, or very specific card text that uses the word “attack," e.g. [[Crave Golem]].

When a unit uses its Defend ability, it automatically becomes a legal target for the attack. For example, a minion with Stealth normally can't be targeted by an attack, but if it chooses to Defend, it will be a legal target (as an explicit exception to the normal precedence in the Silver Rule).

## Movement Paths for Defending
When a unit defends, it must declare a movement path that ends with it occupying the attack's location, ignoring any triggered abilities.

## When Exactly is a Unit Allowed to Defend?
If the unit is untapped and the attack's location is within its range of motion. See "((range of motion))" for more details.
