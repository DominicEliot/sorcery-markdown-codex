# Void
A square without a site is a void. Minions in the void are immediately banished unless they have Voidwalk.

Unlike sites that have two locations (surface and subsurface), a void square only has a single location, the void. Voids do not have a surface or subsurface.

Avatars in the void have a mandatory action.
