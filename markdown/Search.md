# Search
Searching a zone (e.g. [[Adept Illusionist]]) allows you to look at the cards in those zones and potentially find something.

If you search a public zone, then you must find what you're searching for, if possible. If you search a private zone, then you may choose to fail to find what you're searching for, even if it exists in that zone.
