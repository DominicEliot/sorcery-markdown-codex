# Site
A site is a locus of energy within the realm that provides you with mana to cast spells. Sites are usually played by activating your Avatar’s ability, though they may enter the realm in other ways.

You and your opponent may attack each other’s sites to cause life loss, so make sure to place your sites carefully! [[Maelström]] is an example of a site.

When a site is destroyed, put it in its owner’s cemetery, leaving behind a Rubble token.

There is no limit to the number of cards that may occupy the same site.

Sites have characteristics, specifically ((site characteristics)), and are one of the six card types in the game.

To play a site, you will typically use your avatar's ability, though some other effects allow you to play sites in other ways, e.g. [[Frontier Settlers]]. If an effect instructs you to "play a site" (e.g. [[Sorcerer]]), by default you must play it adjacent to one of your existing sites, or as close as possible to your avatar if you don't have any sites. If an effect instructs you to play a site with some positional information (e.g. [[Pathfinder]]), then card text takes precedence and you may ignore the "adjacent to your existing sites" requirement.

When cards refer to "adjacent site" or "nearby site," see ((adjacent)) and ((nearby)) for clarity on how to resolve it.
