# Spell
Spells represent all of your prepared power to contest the realm. These include minions to help you defend your sites and attack the enemy, artifacts to tip the balance of power in your favor, magics to overpower your foes, and auras to impose your will on areas of the realm.

Magics are a type of spell, but minions, artifacts, and auras are all spells as well! Every card in your spellbook is a spell!

See casting spells for more details.
