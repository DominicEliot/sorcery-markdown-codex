# Die
"Dies" is synonymous with "destroyed" and "killed" (and "dispel" for auras).

Whenever a minion has damage on it equal to or greater than its power (or is destroyed directly by an effect), that card is marked for death. After it is marked, any "kill" or Deathrite triggers resolve, and finally the marked card is put into its owner’s cemetery. If multiple cards are marked for death simultaneously, use the normal storyline rules for simultaneous triggers, then all the marked cards are put into their owners’ cemeteries simultaneously.  
  
Once a card has been marked for death, nothing can remove the mark. An effect that heals a marked creature or increases its power does not remove the mark. Certain replacement effects can avoid death entirely (e.g. Ward, [[Gilded Aegis]], [[Lady Iseult]]), in which case the minion was never marked for death at all, because that's how replacement effects work.  
  
An effect may move a marked card to a different zone (e.g. [[Fey Changeling]] on [[The Geistwood]]), but that card is still considered to have died for the purposes of other effects.  
  
If a Deathrite ability causes more cards to die, they are also marked for death, and their Deathrite effects will also trigger before any cards are placed in the cemetery. None of the cards that have been marked for death are put into their owners’ cemeteries until all Deathrite effects have resolved.  
  
Players cannot choose to sacrifice or kill a card that is already marked for death. A card that is already marked for death cannot be marked for death again, and any effect that attempts to destroy or sacrifice that card fails. That card still only triggers its Deathrite ability once.  
  
Cards that are sacrificed also count as being destroyed. They are marked for death following the same process outlined above.
