# Voidwalk
**Keyword Ability. **A minion with Voidwalk can be summoned to void locations and survive in the void.

Whenever a minion without Voidwalk occupies a void location, it is immediately banished. An avatar may never enter the void.

By using one step, a minion with Voidwalk can move between the surface of a site and the void, the subsurface of a site and the void, or between adjacent void locations.

For example, [[Hounds of Ondaros]] can be summoned to any void location. Then, after their summoning sickness wore off, they could use their Move and Attack ability to take a step from the void directly to the subsurface of an adjacent site, or directly to the surface of an adjacent site. If they were underground (or underwater or on the surface), they could use their step to move to an adjacent void.
