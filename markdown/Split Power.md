# Split Power
Some units have split power, with a separate number for attack power and defense power. The first number is attack power and the second number is defense power. For example, [[White Knight]] has 3 attack power and 5 defense power.

Attack power is how much damage the unit will inflict when it strikes. For example, [[White Knight]] will deal 3 damage when it strikes.

Defense power is how much damage the unit can take in a turn before it dies. For example, [[White Knight]] must take 5 or more damage in a turn to be killed.

If an effect needs to know the "power" of a unit with split power, e.g. [[Gnome Hollows]] or [[Chaos Twister]], take the average of the two numbers and round down, if needed. For example, a [[Brother Knight]] could enter Gnome Hollows and would deal 2 damage via Chaos Twister.
