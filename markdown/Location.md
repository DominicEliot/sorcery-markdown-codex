# Location
The smallest area in _Sorcery_. A location is defined by its square AND region.

For example, a square with a void has a single location, that particular void location. At the beginning of the game, there are 20 locations in the realm, all void.

A square with a site has two locations: the surface of the site and the subsurface of the site. Those are two different locations, even though they're in the same square. If the entire 5x4 realm was filled with sites, then the realm would contain 40 locations (the surface and subsurface of each of the 20 sites).
