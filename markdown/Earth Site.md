# Earth Site
An earth site is a site that provides at least one earth (E) affinity.

If the site provides other types of affinity as well, it's still an earth site as long as it provides at least one earth affinity.

In particular, note that a site could be a water site (because it provides water affinity) AND an earth site (because it provides earth affinity). [[Aqueduct]] is an example of a water site and earth site.

Earth site and land site are NOT synonyms.
