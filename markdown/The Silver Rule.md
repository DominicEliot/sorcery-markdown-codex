# The Silver Rule
When card text and rules text conflict, specific card text takes precedence when there is a direct conflict. See also the "Can vs. Can't" codex entry.

The priority from highest to lowest is:

1. Specific card text that says you "can't" do something.
2. Specific card text that says you "can" do something.
3. Rules text that says you "can't" do something.
4. Rules text that says you "can" do something.
