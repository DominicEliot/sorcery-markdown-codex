# Token
Token cards are equivalent to normal cards while in the realm. If they would ever leave the realm, they are banished instead. Tokens have a default cost of zero, though if the token is a copy of another card it will copy that card's characteristics. Players may use anything they wish to represent tokens, as long as the game state is clear.

The owner of a token is typically whoever put it into play, but if a card is transformed into a token, e.g. [[Pollimorph]] or [[Degradation]], the owner of the transformed card is the owner of the token.

Typical token minions include:

- Foot Soldier token
- Frog token
- Tawny
- Bruin

Typical token sites include:

- Rubble

Typical token artifacts include:

- Lance
