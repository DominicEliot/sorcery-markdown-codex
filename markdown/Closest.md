# Closest
When determining "closest," e.g. for [[Persecutor]], imagine the Persecutor had unlimited movement and then ask: Are there any Evil units in Persecutor's range of motion?

If not, there is no "closest" Evil.

If so, the "closest" Evil is the unit that requires the fewest Persecutor steps to reach. (Your choice if tied.)
