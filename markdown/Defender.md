# Defender
Defender is the opposite of attacker. Any attacked _unit_ is considered a defender, even if they didn't use the Defend ability. A unit that uses the Defend ability becomes a defender, but the originally attacked unit is also a "defender" if it stays in the fight.

An attack is “undefended” only if there are no defenders (i.e. attacking a site).
