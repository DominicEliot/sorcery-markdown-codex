# Span of Land
A span of land is a contiguous group of adjacent land sites, **regardless of who controls those sites**.

If a card refers to "its span of land" or "this span of land," it means the span of land occupied by that card. If that card doesn't currently occupy a span of land, then it doesn't have a span of land.

To choose a span of land (e.g. [[Minecart Madness]]), choose one land site. Every land site (regardless of controller) that's connected to the chosen site via adjacent land sites is in that span of land. If a site becomes disconnected from the chosen land site (e.g. [[Earthquake]] in the middle of the turn), the disconnected site is no longer in the span of land. If the chosen site is no longer a land site (e.g. [[Flood]] in the middle of the turn), then the "chosen span of land" no longer exists.
