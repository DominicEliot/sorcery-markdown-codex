# Card
When you are instructed to draw a **card**, you may choose to draw a spell from your spellbook or a site from your atlas. If you draw multiple cards at once (e.g. [[Pact with the Devil]]), choose how many of each you'll draw, then draw all of them simultaneously.

If a game effect or rule references a **card** in the realm, it includes tokens as well.
