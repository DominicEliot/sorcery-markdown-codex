# Life
Avatars have life. Life represents the amount of damage that your Avatar can endure before it is placed on death’s door. As your Avatar takes damage, its overall life decreases accordingly.

An avatar’s maximum life is the value printed on their card (typically 20), and cannot exceed that number. An avatar’s minimum life is zero, and cannot go below that.

When an avatar reaches zero life, it is on Death's Door.
