# Lasts 3 of Your Turns
This terminology is used on various aura, e.g. [[Entangle Terrain]], [[Falling Star]].

To resolve the effect, add a counter at the end of each of your turns, and dispel the aura when there are 3 counters.

If the aura is silenced during your end phase (presumably because it was animated by [[Enchantress]] and then silenced somehow), then no counter will be added that turn.
