# Zero
In _Sorcery, _if there is zero of something, the game considers that thing to not exist at all. For example:

- If a unit takes zero damage, then it did not actually take any damage at all. Triggers looking for damage wouldn't be satisfied.
- If a unit takes zero steps, then it did not move at all. Triggers looking for movement wouldn't be satisfied.
- If you draw zero cards, you did not draw any cards at all. Triggers looking for card draws wouldn't be satisfied.
- etc.

There are two notable exceptions:

- It is possible to strike for zero damage, e.g. [[Grandmaster Wizard]]. The unit still made a strike for effects that are looking for strikes (e.g. [[Phantasmal Shade]]), but the strike didn't do any damage at all.
- It's possible for units to have zero power and still exist in the realm. Units with 0 power (e.g. [[Grandmaster Wizard]]) only die if they take damage (1 or more).

A spell cast for zero mana does not require any mana at all to cast, but it still counts as a cast spell.
