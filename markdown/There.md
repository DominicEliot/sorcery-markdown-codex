# There
"There" refers to the location(s) that the card occupies. For most cards, such as minions and artifacts, that means one location. For example, [[Backstab]]'s use of "there" means the adjacent location of the tapped minion.

For auras, that usually means 4 locations, most commonly the surface of 4 sites.

For sites, "there" includes both the site's surface location and it's subsurface location. For example, [[Upwelling]] will return subsurface minions and artifacts as well as those on the surface.

"There" is analogous to "here."
