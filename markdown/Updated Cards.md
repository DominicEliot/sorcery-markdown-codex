# Updated Cards
A few cards have updated rules text that does not match the printed text. These cards have the "UPDATED:" label on curiosa.io and players should use the updated text.

The majority of updates have been made for rules clarity and design intent, often reflecting the way players have been playing these cards all along. See below for the full list.

**Most Significant Updates**

- [[Druid]] - Tawny is only summoned once; the thorns from the flip side only affect your sites; thorns are a site ability, not the Druid's, and thus can be silenced. Druid was very powerful as originally written and repeated summoning of a free minion (i.e. Tawny) limited future design space.
- [[Infiltrate]] - Control of the infiltrated minion returns when it no longer has Stealth, allowing for interesting counterplay. Infiltrate was very powerful as originally written and it was a thematic miss to retain control even after Stealth was lost.

**Updates to Match Original Design Intent**

- [[Daperyll Vampire]], [[Blood Ravens]], [[Sir Galahad]], [[Mask of Mayhem]], [[Grim Guisarme]], Lance - The abilities on these cards only work when striking units, not sites. This matches design intent. (In an older version of the rules, units didn't strike sites.)
- [[Seirawan Hydra]] - Hydra can be killed by taking 6 or more damage at once. For example, double defense by two [[Bosk Troll]]s will kill a Hydra. This matches design intent and how the card was ))played(( for a long time.
- [[Deathspeaker]] - The cast minion is banished; a copy is summoned (using its Genesis) and also banished, matching design intent and avoiding [[Bottomless Pit]] shenanigans where the minion could have ended up in the cemetery repeatedly.

**Minor Updates for Clarity**

- [[Silence]], [[Sisters of Silence]], [[Magnetic Muzzle]] - These use the "((Silenced))" keyword.
- [[Heat Ray]], [[Ice Lance]], [[Rhongomyniad]] - The projectile must actually hit the unit it will damage. Also, these cannot damage the caster. This matches design intent and players were already playing them this way.
- [[Askelon Phoenix]] - The text uses the phrase "fire damage," matching design intent and maximizing theme.
- [[Vivien the Enchantress]] - Vivian only copies other abilities. That is, she won't copy abilities from other Viviens, avoiding infinite loops.
- [[Pudge Butcher]] - Pudge can only fight units that actually arrive at his location, matching design intent.
- [[Monastery Gargoyle]] - The Gargoyle turns into a monument so that you retain control of it while it's in artifact form, matching design intent.
- [[Purge Juggernaut]] - The Juggernaut won't kill itself. (In a very old version of the rules, automatons weren't minions!)
- [[Squirming Mass]] - The Mass won't gain its own power while dying, matching design intent.
- [[Updraft Ridge]] - Moving freely away matches design intent. As originally written, the minion would technically ))lose(( the movement bonus as soon as it moved away, which wasn't intended.
- [[Awakened Mummies]] - The Mummies fight when they unburrow via their triggered ability. (In an older version of the rules, intercept could interrupt movement.)
- [[Torshammar Trinket]] - The Trinket returns to hand after the turn ends, i.e., after damage has been healed. Also, it will return to hand from the realm even if it's not controlled by anyone. This matches design intent and how players have been playing it.
- [[Truesight Crossbow]] - With truesight, projectiles will hit minions with Stealth, even though hitting with a projectile doesn't target. (In an older version of the rules, Stealth didn't provide protection from projectiles.)
