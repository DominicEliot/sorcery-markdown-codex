# Fly
If you fly a unit somewhere, treat the unit as if it had Airborne while crossing borders, e.g. [[Avatar of Air]]. Fly is synonymous with "throw through the air," e.g. [[Siege Giant]].

For example, a unit being moved by ))Avatar(( of Air's ability will be able to cross the border of a [[Perilous Bridge]] or [[Great Wall]], and will not take damage from a [[Wall of Brambles]], even if it's disabled, silenced, or [[Sky Baron]] is in the realm. Note that this effect is specific to crossing borders (and not entering sites), and therefore [[Bottomless Pit]] will still trigger for non-Airborne minions moved via ))Avatar(( of Air's ability.

If you fly a site somewhere, e.g. [[Cloud City]], treat all units occupying the site as if they had Airborne while the site moves.
