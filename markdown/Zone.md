# Zone
A zone is a general area where a card can exist. Game zones include:

- The realm (a shared zone)
- Each player's spellbook, atlas, cemetery, collection, and hand zones (specific to each player)
- The storyline (a shared zone)
- Additional zones based on specific cards (e.g. [[Morgana le Fay]] creates a "Morgana's hand" zone.)

Public zones include the realm and cemeteries, and cards in these zones have no hidden information, i.e. they're face-up, and you're allowed to look at the opposite side of any card in those zones, e.g. [[Druid]]. For clarity of game state, it's acceptable to put banished cards face-down in a specific area of the table, but they may be reviewed by either player at any time.

The number of cards and type of card (e.g. spell or site) in each zone is public information (e.g. any player can know how many cards remain in any deck, or how many cards of each type you have in your hand).

Each player may view the cards in their own hand and collection.

Cards in the spellbook and atlas are face-down, and thus not visible to any player.
