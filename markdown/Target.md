# Target
A target is the chosen object of a spell or effect. It uses the word "target," and choosing a target is required. For example, [[Arc Lightning]] has a target of a "nearby unit" and [[Red Desert]] has a target of "nearby site."

The source of the ability, or the caster of the spell, must be in the same region as everything it targets.

When you cast a spell or use an ability that targets, before it even goes on the storyline, you must declare all targets. For example, [[Bury]] is a spell that targets, and [[Vile Imp]] has an ability that targets.

You must declare a legal target as the effect goes on the storyline, and the legality of the target is checked again when the effect actually resolves. If you cannot declare a legal target when the spell or ability would enter the storyline, the spell isn't actually cast and the ability can't be used.

See "((Casting Magics))" for more details.
