# Death Blow
A death blow is any damage dealt to an Avatar who is on death's door, other than on the turn they reached death's door. If you deal a death blow to your opponent's avatar, you win! The damage can come from a strike or any effect that specifically deals damage.

Note that attacking their sites causes your opponent's avatar to lose life, which is different from damaging their avatar. Losing life, _including due to site damage_, does not cause a death blow.

If both Avatars suffer a death blow simultaneously (perhaps by one attacking the other), the game is a draw. Alternately, many tournaments declare that simultaneous death blows are ignored, and the game continues.
