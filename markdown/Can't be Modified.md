# Can't be Modified
A card that "can't be modified" cannot be disabled, silenced, immobilized, or transformed. It also cannot gain or lose any abilities, and its characteristics cannot be changed. For example, [[Bedrock]] is not affected by [[Atlantean Fate]] nor [[Abundance]]. As another example, [[Monks of Kobalsa]] cannot gain stealth (since it's an ability) or power (since it's a characteristic).

Note that [[Monks of Kobalsa]] can have their cost reduced (or increased) during casting while they're still in hand, since abilities only apply while in the realm unless explicitly stated.
