# Hand
Your hand contains spells and sites. There is no limit to the number of cards you may have in your hand, and their order is irrelevant.

You may look at cards in your hand at any time. Your opponent is allowed to know how many cards of each type (spell or site) you have in your hand at any time.

For clarity of game state, if you are using card sleeves, you should use different sleeves for sites and spells.

Your hand is one of the zones in the game.
