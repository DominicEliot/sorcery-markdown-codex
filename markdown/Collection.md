# Collection
Your collection includes additional cards and is one of the zones in the game.

You may look at your collection at any time. Your opponent may only know the number and type of cards in your collection.

**Constructed Format**  
Your collection may contain up to 10 cards and must respect rarity limits.

**Limited Formats (Draft or Sealed)**  
Your collection includes all the unplayed cards in your card pool. Furthermore, whenever an effect specifies a _named _card in your collection, you simply get one as if it were in your collection. Take it from outside your card pool, using a substitute if needed.

For example, if you play [[Troubled Town]], you may gain any Townsfolk and cast it. If you play [[Release the Hounds]], you gain two [[Hellhounds]]. On the other hand, if you use [[Toolbox]], you must only select from your unplayed ordinary cards, since no specific card is named by Toolbox's effect.
