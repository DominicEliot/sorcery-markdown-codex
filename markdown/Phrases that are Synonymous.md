# Phrases that are Synonymous
Sorcery cards use natural, thematic language. Some words and phrases are synonymous and have the same game effect:

- Fly. Throw through the air.

- You heal. Gain life.
   - Technically, if a minion heals, its wounds can go away. If a minion gains life, there's no effect. But there are very few cards in the game that ever heal minions, e.g. [[Font of Life]]. The vast majority of healing effects only heal "you," the player.

- Drag. Pull.
   - Note that "Lure" is different, since "Lure" requires the unit to take the step themselves.

- Destroy. Kill. Die. Dispel (for auras).
   - Note that "Banish" is different from those listed above.

- Traverse. Move into. Enter. Leave.
   - Note that "leave" and "enter" obviously care about different locations, but the moment in time is identical. If you move and leave one location, you have simultaneously entered a different location. There's no moment when you're in limbo between locations.

- Atop. Above.

- Near. Nearby.

- On the ground. Onto the ground.

- In the context of a projectile: Shoot. Throw.
