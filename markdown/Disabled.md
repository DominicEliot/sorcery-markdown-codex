# Disabled
While disabled, a minion has no abilities (including basic abilities), cannot strike or deal damage, cannot take steps itself, cannot shoot projectiles, and cannot be tapped to pay for costs.  
  
A disabled minion may be moved forcefully as long the disabled minion does not take one of its own steps. A disabled minion may still be tapped by effects as long as it isn't tapping to pay for costs.  
  
Disabled is not an ability itself and is not removed by silenced effects (e.g. [[Silence]]).

If a site is disabled, it has no abilities and cannot provide any mana or affinity.
