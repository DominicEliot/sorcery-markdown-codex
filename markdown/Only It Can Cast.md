# Only It Can Cast
Some effects allow a non-Avatar to become a special spellcaster, draw a spell, and then only it can cast the spell. For example, [[Char Omphalos]], [[Morgana Le Fay]], or [[Archangel Gabriel]].

The card counts as drawn by you, but it ends up in a separate zone, not your hand. Ensure it does not get mixed up with your normal hand.

Only the controller of the special spellcaster can look at the spell. If the controller changes, the new controller gets to look at the spell and may cast it normally (e.g. meet threshold, etc.).

If the special spellcaster leaves the realm, any remaining spells go to the cemetery.

The special spellcaster may cast the spell, even if they don't normally have spellcaster, e.g. the allied minion blessed by [[Archangel Gabriel]].
