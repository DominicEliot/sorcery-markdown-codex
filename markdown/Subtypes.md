# Subtypes
Subtypes provide additional theme and flavor for a card. Subtypes are capitalized and shown in the card's typeline. For example, the card [[Roaming Monster]] has the "Monster" subtype.

In general, subtypes have no inherent game effect, but other cards may refer to them. For example, [[King of the Realm]] cares about the Mortal subtype.

Artifacts have two special subtypes ("((Automaton))", "((Monument))") that do have inherent game rules. See the those codex entries for more details.
