# End Phase
The end phase is the last phase during your turn.

1. Trigger abilities that happen at the end of the turn.
2. Players remove all damage from their minions in the realm.
   1. Remember that Avatars do not automatically heal in the same way as damage is removed from minions; however, you can heal using spells and other card effects.
3. Effects that last for your turn now end.

Your turn is now over. Anything that triggers "after each turn" resolves now.
