# Ability
All cards in the game have abilities! There are two categories of abilities:

- Basic abilities, which all units have without being printed on their cards.
- Special abilities, which is the card text on each card, or text granted to it by other effects, e.g. [[Black Obelisk]].

Cards also have characteristics, which are distinct from abilities.
