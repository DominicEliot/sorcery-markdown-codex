# Spellcaster
**Keyword Ability. **A card with the Spellcaster keyword may cast spells. Avatars are automatically spellcasters.

Some spellcasters may only cast spells that match a specific element. For example, [[Lava Salamander]] is a Fire Spellcaster, and thus may only cast spells that require Fire threshold (F).
