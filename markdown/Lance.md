# Lance
**Keyword Ability. **A minion with the Lance keyword enters the realm carrying a [[Lance]] artifact token.

A Lance is an Ordinary, Weapon, artifact token with the text:

_Bearer's next strike against units deals +1 damage and strikes first, then Lance breaks._

Further notes:

- There's only one "first strike" window in a fight. More than one Lance confers no extra speed benefit.
- If a unit has multiple Lances, they will each add +1 damage, and all will break after the next strike against a unit.
- Using a Lance is not optional. If a unit is carrying a Lance and strikes a unit, the Lance will be used and break.
- If a unit carrying a Lance strikes a site, the Lance does not break and does not confer additional damage.
- Lances are normal artifacts that can be picked up and dropped as usual.
- When they break, they are removed from the game, like all tokens.
- Since the Lance keyword is an "enters the realm" effect, even if the minion is immediately disabled or silenced when entering the realm, they will still have their Lance with them!
