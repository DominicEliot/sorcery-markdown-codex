# Phrases with Subtle Meanings
Sorcery cards use natural, thematic language. Some words and phrases have different meanings depending on their context. Read the card text carefully to determine which meaning is correct:

- Bottom (deck) vs. Bottom (realm)

- Surface (noun) vs. Surface (verb)

- Aboveground (atop, includes Airborne) vs. "on the ground" (related to movement from surface to surface, excludes Airborne)
   - These two phrases mean different things!

- Water (threshold) vs. Water site (opposite of land site)
   - These are very similar ideas, but not exactly the same.

****

- Fight vs. Attack vs. Strike
   - If a card uses the word **fight**, it ignores normal attack targeting restrictions. E.g. [[Pudge Butcher]] could fight [[Gyre Hippogriffs]] even though they have Airborne and Pudge Butcher does not, and [[Giant Shark]] could fight a [[Band of Thieves]] that moves in the water even though the Thieves have Stealth. All units involved in the fight strike each other simultaneously.
   - If a card uses the word **strike**, it also ignores normal attack targeting restrictions. E.g. [[Grapple Shot]] can allow a [[Bosk Troll]] to strike Gyre Hippogriffs even though they have Airborne and the Troll does not. When a unit strikes due to an effect like Grapple Shot (and not merely a fight), the opposing unit doesn’t strike back.
   - If a card uses the word **attack **in the text, follow normal attack restrictions and card effects, e.g. [[Crave Golem]], which has many FAQs to clarify the effect!
      - Note that some cards use “attack” in the title (e.g. [[Spin Attack]]) but use “strike” in the card text; card text is what matters in this case, not the title.

- Take a step vs. X steps away vs. Push/Pull one step
   - See the "Step" codex entry for more details.

- **Stops** is not the same as **at rest**.
   - A unit **stops** when there is no additional movement for that unit on the storyline. A unit must first move to then stop.
   - **At rest** means nothing is on the storyline. See the "At Rest" codex entry for more details.

- Draw vs. "Put into your hand"
   - If you put a card directly into your hand, you have not drawn it.
