# Ownership and Control
You are the owner of all the cards you bring to a game of _Sorcery_. The owner of a card does not change during the game. A card is always returned to its owner’s hand, shuffled into its owner’s deck, or sent to its owner’s cemetery, regardless of who controls the card when it leaves the realm.

While the owner of a card is most often its controller, control of cards may change over the course of a game, e.g. [[Mesmerism]]. When effects use phrases like “your minions” or “your sites,” it refers to what you control, and not what you own.

By default, cards are controlled by whoever puts them into the realm. For artifacts that can be carried, the controller of the unit that's carrying the artifact also controls the artifact itself. If such an artifact is not carried, it has no controller. For tokens, see the "((Token))" codex entry for details.
