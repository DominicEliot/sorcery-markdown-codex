# Summon
Summon means "enter the realm," for minions. When you cast a minion spell, the result is that you summon that minion, following normal restrictions about casting spells.

When another effect causes you to summon a minion directly without casting it, e.g. [[Mother Nature]], [[Brother Knight]], [[Knighthood]], etc., you simply put it into the realm. You don't need to pay mana, meet threshold requirements, or choose a location you control, as you usually do when you cast a minion spell.

Typically a summon effect will specify where the summoned minion appears. For example, [[Mother Nature]] specifies that the minion is summoned "here," i.e., Mother Nature's location, even if that's an enemy site.

If a summon effect does not specify where the summoned minion appears, e.g. [[Raise Dead]] or [[Plague of Frogs]], you may summon it to any location in any region.

If you try to summon a minion to a location that it can't enter, e.g. [[Gnome Hollows]], it doesn't change zones and remains where it was.
