# Start Phase
The start phase is the first phase you complete during your turn. Follow these steps in order:

1. All abilities that last “Until next turn” now end.
2. All of your cards untap.
3. All of your sites (and other cards) provide their mana for this turn.
4. Trigger and resolve abilities that happen at the start of the turn.
5. Draw a card from either your spellbook or atlas.
   1. On the first player's first turn of the game, they do not draw a card.
