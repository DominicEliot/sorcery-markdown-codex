# Prevention Effect
Prevention effects are very similar to replacement effects, but are specifically related to preventing damage, and apply _after _replacement effects.

For example, [[Tufted Turtle]] is a prevention effect. When applying damage to a Tufted Turtle, first apply any replacement effects (e.g. Lance, [[Critical Strike]]) and then apply the Turtle's prevention effect last. This rule ensures that prevention effects function properly. E.g., you can't somehow apply a Lance after the Turtle's prevention effect was applied, somehow dealing damage, which would be wrong.

For more details, see the "((Damage))" codex entry and subsections.
