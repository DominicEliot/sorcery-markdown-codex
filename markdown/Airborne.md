# Airborne
**Keyword ability.** A unit with Airborne may fly while on the surface. It gains three benefits _while on the surface:_

- When taking a step, it may move diagonally.
- It cannot be targeted by attacks, unless the attacking unit also has Airborne.
- It cannot be intercepted, unless the intercepting unit has Airborne or Ranged.

_Important reminders:_

- **Attacks from Airborne units can be defended normally**! Airborne is mostly a defensive ability and gives greater mobility, but Airborne attacks (against a unit or a site) **can be defended by any unit, even without Airborne**! The Airborne unit must swoop down to attack. Even if an Airborne attacker targets an Airborne defender, a non-Airborne unit may defend, since the original target can bring the fight down to the ground.
- Airborne only works on the surface. If the unit starts its step on the surface of a site, it can step diagonally. If the unit starts its step in a different region (void, underwater, underground), then it can't step diagonally (and also doesn't get the other benefits either).
- Airborne has no effect on counting distance for effects with "up to X steps away," e.g. [[Disenchant]].
