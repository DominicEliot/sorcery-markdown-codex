# Region
There are exactly four regions in _Sorcery_:

- Surface
- Underwater
- Underground
- Void

Even if a group of surface locations is separated by the void from another group of surface locations, there is still only a single surface region. Every surface location is part of the surface region. Every underground location is part of the underground region. Etc.
