# Traverse
Traverse means to move through a border. For example, [[Wall of Brambles]] specifies that it sits atop a border of a site. [[Perilous Bridge]] has a passive ability which affects its top border.

To move through a border, a unit must take a step which causes it to enter a location on one side of the border, having occupied a location on the other side of the border.

## On the Ground
Some effects use the phrase "traverse on the ground," e.g. [[Wall of Brambles]]. To "traverse on the ground," a unit must move from the surface of a site to the surface of another site, excluding Airborne and Teleportation.
