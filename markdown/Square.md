# Square
One grid square in the realm. The default size of the realm is a 5 x 4 grid of squares.

When referring to squares, an effect can cross the boundaries of regions.

The physical dimensions of a grid square can sometimes matter, e.g. [[Chaos Twister]]. Follow the golden rule and tournament rules, but reasonable sizes are between 4.5" and 5".
