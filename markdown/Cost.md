# Cost
Cost is the amount of mana required to cast a spell. Cost can be modified by various effects, e.g. [[Hamlet]]. Cost cannot be negative.

Sites have a default cost of zero.

When determining the mana cost of a spell with an X value (e.g. [[Assorted Animals]]), X is the actual cost while the spell is on the storyline, and otherwise X is zero.

To calculate the total cost of a spell or ability:

- Start with the mana cost or activation cost. For example, (3) for [[Bury]], or (5) if casting via [[De Vermis Mysteriis]].
- Include any additional costs. For example, discarding a site for [[Craterize]].
- Add anything that increases cost. For example, (2) for [[Maddening Bells]].
- Subtract anything that reduces cost. For example, (1) less for [[Philosopher's Stone]].

Note that if you cast the spell "for free" or "for (0)," you do not pay any additional costs at all! For example, [[Deathspeaker]] on Death's Door near a [[Maddening Bells]] will still pay (0) to use the Deathspeaker's ability. See ((For Free)) in the Codex for more details.
