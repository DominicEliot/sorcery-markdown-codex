# Adjacent
Adjacent refers to the current square and the four **orthogonal** squares that share a border with it (not diagonals). For example, the middle square has 5 adjacent squares - itself and four others.

If a square is in the corner of the realm, it will have fewer adjacent squares. For example, the bottom right square has only 3 adjacent squares - itself and two others.

When referring to **adjacent sites**, **adjacent voids**, or **adjacent squares**, the effect can cross the boundaries of regions. For example, [[Lord of the Void]] can be in the void and still banish an adjacent site, even though sites and voids are in different regions. [[Frontier Settlers]] can be on a site and still play your top site to an adjacent void, even though sites and voids are in different regions.

**For all other references to adjacent**, such as adjacent locations, adjacent minions, adjacent artifact, etc., _regional boundaries must be respected and cannot be crossed_. For example, if a minion with Voidwalk was attacked while at a site and then played [[Dodge Roll]], it could not move to a void square because "adjacent location" cannot cross a regional boundary.
