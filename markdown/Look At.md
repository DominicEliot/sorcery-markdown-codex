# Look At
When a card instructs you to "look at" cards in a zone, you do not reveal those cards to other players, only you look at them.  This is similar to, but distinct from, a "search."

Whenever you return cards that you have looked at to a deck, you may put them back in any order unless the effect specifies otherwise.
