# Lethal
**Keyword Ability. **Any damage a Lethal unit deals to a minion is enough to kill it. (Remember that zero damage isn't damage at all, so it will need to do one or more damage.)

For example, [[Pit Vipers]] can kill [[Amazon Warriors]] with a single strike for 1 damage. If the Amazon Warriors had their [[Shield Maidens]] nearby, then the Pit Vipers wouldn't actually kill the Amazon Warriors, because they'd do zero damage, which isn't actually damage at all.
