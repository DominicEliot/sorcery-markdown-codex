# Lose
Some effects will cause artifacts, minions, and sites to lose certain abilities, often keywords. “Lose” really means "lose, can't gain, and can't have." These effects take precedence over competing passive abilities. E.g. [[Sky Baron]] wins, even if I give [[Wings of Invention]] to my minion after you summoned Sky Baron. It’s relevant to these cards:

[[Sisters of Silence]], [[Silence]], [[Entangle Terrain]], [[Sky Baron]], [[Atlantean Fate]], [[Scent Hounds]], [[House of Ondaros]], [[Master Tracker]], [[Magnetic Muzzle]], [[Smokestacks of Gnaak]], [[Watchtower]], [[Hunting Party]], [[Sir Bors the Younger]], [[Pebbled Paths]]

See the "Can vs. Can't" codex entry for more details.
