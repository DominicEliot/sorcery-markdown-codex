# Play
The word “play” is synonymous with “cast” for purposes of spells.

For sites, the word “play” means selecting the site and placing it in the realm. Unlike spells that enter the storyline, playing sites does not use the storyline. They go directly from your hand (or sometimes from a different zone) to the realm.
