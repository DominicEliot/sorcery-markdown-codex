# Uncontrolled
Some cards in the realm are uncontrolled, meaning that neither player controls them. For example, a carriable artifact that's not currently being carried is uncontrolled.

If an uncontrolled card has a trigger, e.g. [[Angel's Egg]], the owner of the card orders the trigger with other effects they control, as needed.
