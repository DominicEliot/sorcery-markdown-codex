# Step
Step has two meanings in _Sorcery_!

1. A step is the smallest measure of distance in _Sorcery_, equal to the distance between two adjacent locations in the same region, e.g. "up to 2 steps away" on cards like [[Dispel]].
2. A step is also the smallest distance a unit can travel when moving, e.g. "take a step" on cards like [[Leap Attack]].

If an effect uses "**up to X steps away**," use the first definition. Movement abilities do not apply because you're not moving anywhere, you're checking distance. Simply count 1 adjacent square per step, without crossing region boundaries. Examples include [[Payload Trebuchet]] and [[Sleep]].

If an effect uses "**push/pull/drag one step**," also use the first definition, because the unit is not moving of their own volition. This is forced movement. Simply count 1 adjacent square per step, without crossing region boundaries. Examples include [[Whirlwind]] and [[Wind Sylph]].

If an effect uses "**take a step**"** **or "**move one step**," the unit is moving itself and may use abilities like Airborne, Voidwalk, Burrow, and Submerge, crossing region boundaries. Use the second definition. An Immobile unit could not "take a step" at all. Examples include [[Guile Sirens]], which could make a nearby Airborne enemy take a diagonal step toward them, and [[Leap Attack]], which could allow a Burrowed minion to unburrow to the surface and strike all the units there.

Note that the Moves Freely ability only applies during the "Move and Attack" and "Defend" basic abilities.
