# As If Connected
Some effects allow movement "as if the top and bottom edges of the realm were connected" e.g. [[Polar Explorers]].

To resolve these effects, imagine a duplicate copy of the realm ))above(( the top row, and ))below(( the bottom row. That is, those squares are considered adjacent **for movement**. Importantly, the squares are _not actually connected for other effects_, so something like [[Poison Nova]] on the top row wouldn't hit the bottom row, since Poison Nova isn't movement.

Moving "as if connected" does cross borders normally, and uses normal cardinal directions.

Oversized units that move as if connected and then find themselves spanning the realm will immediately end up on one side or the other. See "((Oversized Units))" for more details.

Most forced movement effects require proximity and thus won't work across the top and bottom edge when moving "as if connected." For example, [[Whirlwind]] could theoretically push across the top or bottom edge because a "push" counts as movement, but you won't be able to select a 2x2 area that spans the top and bottom edges, because those rows are not actually connected; [[Polar Explorers]] merely allow _movement _"as if" connected, not "selecting 2x2 areas as if connected." (In contrast, if [[Magellan Globe]] were in the realm, then you really could select 2 squares in the top row and 2 squares in the bottom row, because Magellan Globe actually connects the edges, for all purposes.)

An example of a forced movement effect that would work is [[Maelström]]:

_See live codex for table_

[[Maelström]] is at M, and [[Polar Bears]] are at P. The whole area is a giant body of water. You could pull normally to X, or could pull "as if connected" to M since pulling is a form of movement.
