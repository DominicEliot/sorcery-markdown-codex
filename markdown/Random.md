# Random
Random effects are those that use the word "random" or involve rolling a ))die((, e.g. [[Salmon of Knowledge]].

To determine a random outcome, use any reasonable method, such as rolling a ))die((, assigning equal probability to each possible outcome. For example, if there are three units at the location you target with [[Lightning Bolt]], you could assign 1-2 to the first unit, 3-4 to the second unit, and 5-6 to the third unit, then roll a six-sided ))die((.
