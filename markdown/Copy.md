# Copy
When a card enters the realm as a copy, e.g. [[Mirror Realm]] or [[Selfsame Simulacrum]], its characteristics and abilities match the copied card. If the copying card (e.g. Selfsame Simulacrum) leaves the realm, it reverts to its printed characteristics and abilities.

When you create a copy, e.g. an artifact via [[Replication]] or a magic via [[Archimago]] or [[Orb of Ba'al Berith]], the characteristics and abilities match those printed on the copied card, and the copy is a token. For example, in the case of a copied magic, it will be banished as soon as it resolves from the storyline, per the normal token rules.
