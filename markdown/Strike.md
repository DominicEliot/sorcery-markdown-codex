# Strike
Strike simply means to deal damage equal to the unit's power. For example, if a [[Bosk Troll]] strikes, it strikes for 3 damage.

In a fight, units strike each other simultaneously. Some abilities allow units to strike first, e.g. Lance.

Split power units deal damage equal to their attack power when they strike.

## Strikes vs. Multiple Units
At the moment a strike is resolving against multiple units, the controller of the striking unit declares how to split up the damage among the struck units. The damage may be split up however you prefer, including assigning zero damage to some units (see below). The total damage assigned must equal the total power of the strike.

Units assigned zero damage are still considered struck, and the striking unit makes a total of one strike, split among multiple units. The damage is inflicted simultaneously on all units.

## Strikes for Zero Damage
A strike for zero damage, e.g. [[Grandmaster Wizard]], is still a strike, even though it doesn't do damage. See the "zero" codex entry for more details.
