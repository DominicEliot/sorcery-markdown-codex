# Here
"Here" refers to the location(s) that the card occupies. For most cards, such as minions and artifacts, that means one location. For example, [[Fey Changeling]].

For auras, that usually means 4 locations, most commonly the surface of 4 sites. For example, [[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]. Another example is the use of "here" on [[Evil Presence]], which includes the site surfaces but could also include void squares as well, if the aura occupied a void square.

When a site itself uses the word "here," that includes both the site's surface location and it's subsurface location. For example, [[Dome of Osiros]] protects minions in its subsurface as well as surface.

"Here" is analogous to "there."
