# Mana
Mana can come from several sources, but sites are the most common. When a mana source enters the realm on your turn, and during your start phase, they generate mana.

You use this mana to cast spells or activate abilities. At the end of your turn, any remaining mana is lost, whether or not you used it that turn.

You may not generate mana on your opponent's turn.
