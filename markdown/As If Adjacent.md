# As If Adjacent
Some effects allow movement "as if adjacent" e.g. [[Minecart Madness]].

If it matters, the controller of the movement effect decides the cardinal direction when a unit is moving “as if adjacent.” For example, if you have a [[Waypoint Portal]] active and you want to move your [[East-West Dragon]] through it, you can choose to consider the movement horizontal and Move Freely, even if the two squares are not the same row. Similarly, a [[Dalcean Phalanx]] could step through a Waypoint Portal to a square in a different column by declaring the proper cardinal direction for the "as if adjacent" movement.

Units moving "as if adjacent" do not cross any borders. Therefore, a [[Waypoint Portal]] would allow you to circumvent a [[Wall of Ice]] or [[Great Wall]], which look for crossing borders.
