# Rubble
Rubble is a Ordinary site token with the ability "Provides no mana." It also has no affinity and is controlled by no one. When a site is destroyed, it leaves behind a Rubble token.

When a site would enter the realm, it may replace a Rubble as if the Rubble were a void, following all other normal site placement rules. In all other ways, Rubble is treated the same as any other site. For example, because it has no water affinity, it is a land site.
