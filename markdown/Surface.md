# Surface
Surface has two meanings in Sorcery! Sorry about that! English is tricky.

Surface as a noun means "the top layer of a site," as in "the surface of a site." This is the more common usage of the word, which you can see on [[Buried Treasure]], [[Teleport]], or [[Bone Rabble]].

Surface as a verb means "to move up from underwater," as in "surface the submerged minion." You can see examples of this on [[Diluvian Kraken]], [[Iceberg]], and [[Mudflow]].

Void squares do not have a surface (or subsurface).
