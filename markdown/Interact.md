# Interact
A unit "interacts" with the realm if it does any of the following things:

- Strikes
- Casts a spell
- Activates a special ability
   - Note that only ((activated abilities)) can be activated. Triggered abilities and passive abilities aren't activated.
   - Note that a "((special ability))" is different from a "((basic ability))".
- Deal damage (even if the damage is prevented)

Note that "deal damage" is mostly but not fully covered by the first three bullet points. "Activates a special ability" doesn't include triggered abilities, since only activated abilities can be activated. There are some triggered abilities that could deal damage, e.g. [[Infernal Legion]] or [[Colicky Dragonettes]], which are intentionally included in "interacting."
