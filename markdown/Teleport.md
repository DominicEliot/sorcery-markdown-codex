# Teleport
Teleportation is forced movement directly from one location to another. Teleportation does not cross borders, and does not have a defined cardinal direction (even if the two locations are in the same row or column).

Teleportation from the same location to itself is not movement at all; in that case, the unit never left the location and never entered it again.

See the "Oversized Units" codex entry for more details on teleportation with oversized units.
