# Nearby
Nearby refers to the current square and the eight squares that surround it (including diagonals). For example, the middle square has 9 nearby squares - itself and eight others.

If a square is in the corner of the realm, it will have fewer nearby squares. For example, the bottom right square has only 4 nearby squares - itself and three others.

When referring to **nearby sites**, **nearby** **voids**, or **nearby squares** the effect can cross the boundaries of regions. For example, [[Ultimate Horror]] can be in the void and still summon to a nearby site, even though sites and voids are in different regions.

**For all other references to nearby**, such as nearby locations, nearby minions, nearby artifact, etc., _regional boundaries must be respected and cannot be crossed_. For example, if [[Belfry]] is on a site, it will not untap allies in a nearby void, because "nearby ally" cannot cross a regional boundary.
