# Aura
Auras are mostly incorporeal but lasting manifestations of elemental power.  They usually affect a 2x2 area and can be cast anywhere in the realm. [[Entangle Terrain]] is an example of an aura.

Auras have characteristics, specifically ((aura characteristics)), and are one of the six card types in the game.

The "((Casting Auras))" entry has details on how to cast aura spells.
