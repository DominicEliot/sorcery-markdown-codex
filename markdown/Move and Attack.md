# Move and Attack
**Move and Attack** is a basic, activated ability with the following text:

_Tap -> This unit may take one step. Then, it may attack._

## Movement
Normally the unit's movement path is one step between two adjacent surface locations, but some abilities may modify this, including Movement +X, Moves Freely, Burrowing, Submerge, Airborne, and Voidwalk (and effects like [[Felbog Frog Men]]).

Steps resolve one at a time. Because some abilities may change as your unit moves through the realm, you may declare seemingly-illegal movement paths. That is, the legality of the movement path is only checked step by step, as each individual step is about to happen. If the step is not legal at the moment you try to take it, you do not take that step, and you continue resolving anything remaining. See the examples below for further details.

When you declare movement, the only restriction is that you may not repeat specific steps.

If your unit takes at least one step, it has moved; if it takes zero steps, it has not moved.

## Declaring The Attack Target
The Move and Attack ability does not use the word "target," so you do not declare any targets in advance. As it resolves from the storyline, you declare your full movement path, then resolve that movement.

After completing all the movement (if any), you may attack, declaring your attack target at that time. See the "((attack))" codex entry for further details on the attack sequence.

## Example - Declaring a Seemingly Illegal Movement Path
_See live codex for table_

[[Rimland Nomads]] are at A, in a [[Silence]] aura on the leftmost 2x2 area. You use their Move and Attack basic ability and declare the following movement path:

- Surface A -> Surface B
- Surface B -> Surface C

Since the Nomads are in a Silence aura, they do not currently have Movement +1 and therefore they wouldn't normally be able to take two steps. Nonetheless, you can declare the path and see what happens. Once they step onto B, they're out of the aura. The game tries to resolve the second step and notices that, yes, the Nomads do have the capacity to take a second step, so they do, and end up at C.
