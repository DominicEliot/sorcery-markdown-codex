# Ward
**Keyword Ability. **If a warded site or unit would be targeted by an opponent's spell or special ability, damaged, or destroyed, the Ward breaks instead.

Ward is tracked with a ward token. A unit or site can have at most one Ward.

Evil minions can't be warded. If a Warded minion becomes Evil, remove the Ward token and they lose Ward. Note that [[Persecutor]] only causes your cards to treat the branded minion as Evil, so they keep their Ward token.

Only units and sites can have Wards. If a unit or site with Ward becomes a non-unit, non-site, remove the Ward token and they lose Ward.

A unit or site with the Ward keyword enters the realm with a Ward token. If a minion or site becomes disabled or silenced, it will lose its Ward token, since Ward is an ability (similar to Stealth).

Further Notes:

- Ward is a damage prevention effect. For example, if your [[Daperyll Vampire]] strikes my warded [[Apprentice Wizard]], the Vampire will try to deal 4 damage, the Ward prevents it and breaks, the Apprentice Wizard survives, and you do not heal from the Vampire's strike.
   - If a warded unit would take damage from multiple sources simultaneously, all simultaneous damage is prevented and the Ward breaks.
- You can target your own warded units and sites with your own spells and special abilities.
- Ward protects against any damage (from you or your opponent), any destruction (from you or your opponent), and targeting via special abilities and spells (from your opponent only).
   - For example, if I tried to [[Bury]] your warded minion, I could cast the magic since your minion is a valid target. The Bury goes onto the Storyline. Then, as Bury resolves from the Storyline, the Ward protects the targeted minion and breaks, and minion isn't burrowed.
- Ward protects the targeted minion or site _at the time the effect resolves_. You resolve as much of the effect as you can otherwise.
   - For example, I cast [[Grievous Insult]] targeting your warded minion. The spell goes onto the storyline. Then as the Magic is resolving, the Ward protects the targeted minion and breaks, and minion isn't silenced or tapped. Then, I still get to draw a spell.
   - Another example: I cast [[Bury]] targeting your warded minion while carrying a [[Ring of Morrigan]]. The Bury goes onto the Storyline. The Ring of Morgana triggers, dealing 1 damage to warded minion. The Ward protects the minion and breaks, dealing no damage. Then, as Bury resolves from the Storyline, the Ward is already gone so the minion is burrowed.
- If a Ward protects a target, additional effects that rely on the target do not resolve.
   - For example, I cast [[Geyser]] on your warded site. The Ward protects the site and breaks. No minions gain Airborne, since "there" references the site, which was the protected target. Similarly, [[Craterize]] would deal no damage at all if it targeted a warded site.
   - Another example: My [[Abaddon Succubus]] tries to lure your warded minion. The Ward protects the minion and breaks. The protected minion does not take a step closer, does not take 2 damage, and I do not heal 2.
- Note that Move and Attack is a Basic Ability, and thus Ward does not protect a unit from being attacked. For example, if I have a warded Apprentice Wizard, you ))can attack(( it. But, once we get to strikes in the attack sequence, assuming you actually strike for 1 or more damage, the Apprentice Wizard's Ward will break at that point, preventing the damage.
