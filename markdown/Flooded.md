# Flooded
**Keyword ability.** A flooded site has a minimum of one water affinity (W). Therefore, it's a water site, though it still provides other elemental affinities, if any.

For example, if a [[Humble Village]] was flooded, it would provide earth (E) affinity and water (W) affinity. It would be a water site and an earth site.

If an effect "floods" a site (e.g. [[Geyser]]), that site gains the Flooded ability for the stated duration. Since Flooded is an ability, effects that remove abilities from sites will also remove Flooded.
