# Fight
When units fight, they strike each other. Apply the following sequence to resolve a fight:

1. First strikes resolve (e.g. Lance, [[Albespine Pikemen]]).
2. Resolve deathrites and "kill" effects (and "successfully attack" effects if this fight was part of an attack). Place dead minions in cemeteries.
3. Normal strikes happen.
4. Resolve deathrites and "kill" effects (and "successfully attack" effects if this fight was part of an attack). Place dead minions in cemeteries.

Whenever a unit is striking against multiple other units (for example, if there are multiple defenders), the controller decides how the strike damage is distributed. There is still only a single strike from that unit (though some of the struck units could be struck for zero damage).
