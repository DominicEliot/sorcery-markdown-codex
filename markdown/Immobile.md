# Immobile
**Keyword ability.** An Immobile unit cannot take steps.

For example, if you use the Move and Attack basic ability, an Immobile unit can't take steps, though it can still attack and defend at that location. An Immobile unit couldn't take any steps with [[Leap Attack]] but it could still strike.

Forced movement effects apply normally to Immobile units, so they can [[Blink]] or [[Grapple Shot]] like any other unit.
