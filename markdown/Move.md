# Move
"Move" means to go from one location in the realm to a different location in the realm. There are many ways for units in _Sorcery _to move.

The most common way for a unit to move is the Move and Attack basic ability.

Another way for a unit to move is a forced movement effect, including teleportation.

Notably, if a unit enters a location from a different zone, e.g. summoning a minion from your hand, cemetery, or spellbook, that does not count as moving (though it is "entering"). Finally, note that if a unit tries to "move" from its current location to that same location, it's not actually moving at all.

## Moving to a Specific Location Via a Special Ability or Magic
Some card effects specify movement to a specific location, typically by a triggered ability. For example [[Giant Shark]], [[Mount Ussar Sanctuary]], or [[Guardian Angel]]. Some spells also provide such an effect, e.g. [[Harpyon Urge]].

When resolving such an effect, the controller of the effect must specify a path that is the fewest possible steps to the destination. If there are multiple equally short paths, the controller chooses. If no such path exists, the unit doesn't move at all.

See ((Range of Motion)) for how to apply lookahead when determining the path.

Note that the basic abilities "Move and Attack" and "Defend" do not require the player to choose the shortest path to the destination because they are limited by the unit's movement (typically just a single step).
