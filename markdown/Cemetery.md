# Cemetery
Your cemetery represents a record of your contest in the realm. Whenever any of your cards are discarded, destroyed, or resolved, place them face-up in your cemetery.

Players may freely examine the contents of any cemetery at any time, and the order of the cards in a cemetery is irrelevant.

Each cemetery is a zone in the game.
