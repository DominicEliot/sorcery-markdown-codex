# You
"You" and "your" in card text refers to the player. For example, [[Sparkmage]] cares about "spells you've cast," which includes any spells from any of your spellcasters. As another example, [[Bone Rabble]] would trigger if you used your Avatar's ability or if you used [[Frontier Settlers]].

Some older cards use the word "you" to mean "your avatar." _If it's impossible to read the card as "player" in a sensible way,_ then use "avatar" instead. For example, [[Cerberus in Chains]] follows your avatar and [[Avatar of Earth]] looks at her own adjacent sites.
