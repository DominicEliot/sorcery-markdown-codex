# Setup
Follow these steps to set up the game:

1. Clearing some space in the middle of the table for the realm.
2. Each player places their Avatar on the square in the middle of their bottom row.
3. Players shuffle and place their atlas and spellbook decks somewhere close by, leaving some space for their cemeteries.
4. Players randomly decide who goes first.
5. Each player draws three cards from their atlas and three cards from their spellbook.
   1. The first player may mulligan up to three cards from their hand, placing them on the bottom of their respective decks in any order. Then, they redraw the same number of cards from each deck.
   2. The second player may mulligan in the same way.

Some tournament rules may modify the setup procedure.
