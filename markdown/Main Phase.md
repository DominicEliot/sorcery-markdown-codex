# Main Phase
The main phase is where most of Sorcery’s actions and events take place. During this phase, your units can be ordered to do two types of actions. They can:

- Cast a spell from your hand if they are a Spellcaster, or
- Activate one of their abilities

You may have your units do these as many times as you have resources to do so, and in any order you like. For example, you might have one minion use their Move and Attack basic ability, then cast a spell with your Avatar, then have a minion use their Pick Up basic ability, then have a different minion use their Move and Attack ability.
