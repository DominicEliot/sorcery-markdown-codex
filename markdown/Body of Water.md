# Body of Water
A body of water is a contiguous group of adjacent water sites, **regardless of who controls those sites**.

If a card refers to "its body of water" or "this body of water" (e.g. [[Anui Undine]] or [[Giant Shark]]), it means the body of water occupied by that card. If that card doesn't currently occupy a body of water, then it doesn't have a body of water.

To choose a body of water (e.g. [[Marine Voyage]]), choose one water site. Every water site (regardless of controller) that's connected to the chosen site via adjacent water sites is in that body of water. If a site becomes disconnected from the chosen water site (e.g. [[Earthquake]] in the middle of the turn), the disconnected site is no longer in the body of water. If the chosen site is no longer a water site (e.g. [[Drought]] in the middle of the turn), then the "chosen body of water" no longer exists.
