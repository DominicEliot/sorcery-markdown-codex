# Spellbook
Your spellbook is your deck of spells and is one of the zones in the game.

Only spells can be placed or shuffled into your spellbook. If an effect would cause an atlas card to be shuffled into a spellbook, that effect is ignored.

**Constructed Format**  
Your spellbook must contain 60 or more spells and respect rarity limits.

**Limited Formats (Draft or Sealed)**  
Your spellbook must contain 24 or more spells, ignoring rarity restrictions.
