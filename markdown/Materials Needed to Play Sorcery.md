# Materials Needed to Play Sorcery
A deck, a way to track life, and a fun attitude! A playmat will also help, but it's not strictly required!

Your deck includes 1 avatar, a spellbook, and an atlas. Depending on the format (constructed vs. draft/sealed), the minimum deck size varies, so explore those codex entries for more details.
